The result of an operation between unaligned Series will have the union of the indexes involved. If a label is not found
in one Series or the other, the result will be marked as missing NaN. Being able to write code without doing any explicit
data alignment grants immense freedom and flexibility in interactive data analysis and research. The integrated data
alignment features of the pandas data structures set pandas apart from the majority of related tools for working with
labeled data.

Note: In general, we chose to make the default result of operations between differently indexed objects yield the
union of the indexes in order to avoid loss of information. Having an index label, though the data is missing, is
typically important information as part of a computation. You of course have the option of dropping labels with
missing data via the dropna function.
