Advanced Demuffin will then start converting the disk.	After the disk has been
converted, and Advanced Demuffin displays this message "PRESS ANY KEY TO
CONTINUE", you should write down all the sectors that read errors on them.  If
you have a printer, all you have to do is press the slot number of the printer,
and Advanced Demuffin will dump the screen to the printer.

You should then re-convert the sectors that had read errors (use at least
2-retries).  If those sectors don't convert this time, they are probably just
un-written DOS 3.2 sectors.

Use Super Copy III or Master Create to copy dos on to the target disk.	You
should then rename the "hello" program from ^HELLO to HELLO.

You should then have (hopefully) a cracked copy of Castle Wolfenstein!
